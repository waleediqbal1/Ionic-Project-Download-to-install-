# Ionic-Project-Download-to-install-
Download demo ionic2  project from Github and then configure it so that we can change it and then install it on android device.
# Download the repository from Github 
- Go on  [https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-conference-app] and clone the repository to your required location.
If this is zip file then unzip it on the desired location.
This file's name is ionic-conference-app. Actually in this folder we have another folder with the same name and we just need the inner folder so ctrl+x the inner foler name with (ionic-conference-app) to some other place where you need to place it and rename it to some other short name. (This name is too big and it caused error for me while installation so that's why i am asking for change of name for this foler to short one).
